This project focuses on computing for sustainability and emphasizes the design of new computing methods (algorithms, optimization, machine learning) for  decarbonizing societal infrastructure such as energy grids, buildings, transportation systems.  Much of this work is interdisciplinary in nature and involves collaborations with engineers as well social and behavioral scientists. Project research includes 


* Decarbonizing heating and gas grids 
* Renewables and battery storage 
* Decarbonizing buildings and distribution grids
* Equitable energy transition 
* EV charging and ride sharing
