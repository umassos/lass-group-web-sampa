This project focuses on mobile sensing for health applications such as monitoring of sleep, stress 
and social routines. Our work is developing a new approach called non-intrusive health monitoring,
which emphasizes passive sensing of user behavior in a privacy-preserving and non-intrusive manner.
Our approaches combine mobile sensing, systems, and machine learning for continuous monitoring and to derive 
health insights. Ongoing work focuses on the following topics

* Passive wifi sensing of sleep
* Privacy-preserving health monitoring
* Monitoring of group and social interactions
