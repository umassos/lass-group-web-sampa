The Smart* project seeks to optimize energy consumption in homes, with specific attention to modern 'smart homes' and
the new opportunities made available by such homes. A corecomponent of the project is several heavily-instrumented smart
homes that provide us with a testbed to gather real-life data and experiment with new techniques and algorithms to
improve home energy efficiency. To facilitate further research on sustainability in smart homes, we have also released a
significant subset of our data, which is available at this page.

In the course of the Smart* project, we have investigated a wide range of topics involving the design, deployment, and
efficient use of smart homes for sustainability, such as:

* **Whole-House Monitoring**: High-fidelity data collection at scale within homes, including electrical, environmental, and operation data
* **Smart Appliance Control**: Automatically modifying the patterns of energy usage in home devices to reduce costs and improve overall efficiency
* **Renewable Energy Use**: Maximizing the benefits of renewable energy resources to offset power drawn from the electrical grid

### Data and Software Releases
1. UMass Smart* Home Data Set
   This data set includes a variety of traces from three separate smart homes. These traces are available from our [trace repository](http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Smart/Smart).

2. UMass Smart* Microgrid Data Set
   This data set includes electrical data from over 400 homes. These traces are also available from our [trace repository](http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Smart/Smart).

3. Smart* Software Tools
   These tools include utilities to facilitate data collection using commdity sensors. Source code is available from our [software repository](http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Smart/Tools).
